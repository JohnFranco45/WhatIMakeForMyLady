        <ol>
            <li>
                Devein the shrimp and take the shell off. Now you have the option of keeping the head of the shrimp or  removing it and if you keep the head to marinate with the rest of the ingredients. I promise you, its a free ticket to flavor town.
            </li>
            <li>
